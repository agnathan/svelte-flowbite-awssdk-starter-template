# SvelteKit Environment Variables

# This file is loaded by SvelteKit/Vite at build time.
# Variables starting with  are exposed to the client-side code.
# Variables WITHOUT the  prefix are ONLY accessible on the server-side.

# For local development, create a .env.local file and put your
# sensitive keys there. Add .env.local to your .gitignore.
